# Verified Plugins

## Introduction

This list contains plugins that have been verified as LAPI-Compliant.  
 That means that they follow the rules we have set, and that they don't contain malicious code.  
 Even if your plugin complies to the rules we have set, LAPI Developers hold all rights to deny a Plugin to be added to Plugin List  


Do verify if the version of the plugin you're downloading is in the range of supported versions, for we've only checked those.  


Regardless, we don't take any responsibility if it breaks.
