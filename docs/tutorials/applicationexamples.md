# Examples

You can find a few examples of how to use LyokoAPI in your application [Here](https://github.com/LyokoAPI/LyokoForDummies)  
 Remember that these are just examples, and you should carefully consider how to structure your own project.  
 Most of note might be the event calling in the different projects, and the working with plugins in the main class.
