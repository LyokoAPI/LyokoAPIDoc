# Examples
You can find a few examples of how to use LyokoAPI in your application [Here](https://github.com/LyokoAPI/LyokoForDummies)<br>
Remember that these are just examples, and you should carefully consider how to structure your own project.<br>
Most of note might be the event calling in the different projects, and the working with plugins in the main class.
