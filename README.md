# Welcome to the LyokoAPI Docs

LyokoAPI \(LAPI\) is a project that aims to connect Applications with a Code Lyoko theme to each other, primarily in the form of Plugins.

Currently, the target language is C\# \(.NET Framework 4.5\)  
 Do contact us if you want to make an API in another language, we'd love to contribute!
